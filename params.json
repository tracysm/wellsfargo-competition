{"name":"Wellsfargo-competition","tagline":"","body":"**# Wells Fargo Competition**  \r\nIn this Wells Fargo Competition we were to separate the comments from the data we received from Wells Fargo that was online statements involving 4 Banks- **Bank A, Bank B, Bank C, and Bank D** from Twitter and Facebook.. Then, each was to be separated into **positive** or **negative** so it could be visible which bank had the most positive statements about it and which had the most negative statements about it. In society today, the internet and everything posted online is very important. A negative or positive statement about a bank can spread MUCH faster on social media rather than just spreading it by mouth. Different companies have to take this into consideration when trying to fix problems, understand the way their customers think about them, and understand how to attract more customers. The point of this website is to help companies understand what certain things about the companies are said in a positive or negative way and to help predict in the future what will be said, and what can be fixed.  \r\nThis specific plot graph below shows the positive sentiment scores from each Bank. The higher the score, the more positive things said about the bank- **Bank A ** being the highest. Also, here is the code used to create the plot graph.\r\n\r\n![](http://imgur.com/DQ3hz4P)\r\nAbove is just the average sentiment score.. below is the negative sentiment score, putting **Bank B** at the highest, or the most negative comments. \r\n![](http://imgur.com/vXfxtHu)\r\n\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
