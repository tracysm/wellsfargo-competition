{"name":"Wells Fargo Competition!","tagline":"","body":"#**Wells Fargo Competition**  \r\n##*Background Information* \r\nIn this Wells Fargo Competition we were to separate the comments from the data we received from Wells Fargo that was online statements involving 4 Banks- **Bank A, Bank B, Bank C, and Bank D** from Twitter and Facebook.. Then, each was to be separated into **positive** or **negative** so it could be visible which bank had the most positive statements about it and which had the most negative statements about it. In society today, the internet and everything posted online is very important. A negative or positive statement about a bank can spread MUCH faster on social media rather than just spreading it by mouth. Different companies have to take this into consideration when trying to fix problems, understand the way their customers think about them, and understand how to attract more customers. The point of this website is to help companies understand what certain things about the companies are said in a positive or negative way and to help predict in the future what will be said, and what can be fixed.  \r\nThis specific plot graph below shows the positive sentiment scores from each Bank. The higher the score, the more positive things said about the bank- **Bank A ** being the highest. Also, here is some of the code used to create the plot graph.  \r\n```\r\n meanscore = tapply(scores$score, scores$label, mean)\r\ndf.plot = data.frame(label=names(meanscore), meanscore=meanscore)\r\ndf.plot$labels <- reorder(df.plot$label, df.plot$meanscore)\r\n\r\nggplot(df.plot, aes(x = factor(labels), y = meanscore, fill=labels)) +\r\n  geom_bar(stat=\"identity\") +\r\n  scale_fill_manual(values=cols[order(df.plot$meanscore)]) +\r\n  labs(title = \"Topics's Average Sentiment Score\") + \r\n  xlab('Topic') + ylab('Average Score')  \r\n```\r\n![Average Sentiment](http://i.imgur.com/DQ3hz4P.png)  \r\nAbove is just the average sentiment score.. below is the negative sentiment score, putting **Bank B** at the highest, or the most negative comments.    \r\n![Average Neg Sentiment](http://i.imgur.com/vXfxtHu.png)  \r\nAnother thing we did that may have worked better if we had more time is labeling a random 1000, out of the hundreds of thousands of comments, by hand.  \r\nThe labels I used are:  \r\n1. Spam- Spam will be taken out of the coding because it is unnecessary and not helpful in predicting whether someone will say something positive or negative about a bank.  \r\n2. Online- Online includes the many complaints or compliments about the apps, online banking, online checks, etc.  \r\n3. Money- A kind of vague label but includes anything to do with checks, deposits, ATMs, withdrawals, cash, etc.  \r\n4. Service- Anything to do with phone calls with a bank employee, long/short phone calls, long/short wait time, negative/positive comments about employees, responses from service back to customer, etc.  \r\n5. Fraud- Anything about money being taken out that wasn't supposed to, cards being compromised, fraud notifications, etc. Almost all fraud labels are negative.  \r\n6. Job- Anything to do with a specific bank at a specific location or someone being hired/having an interview at a place.  \r\n7. Promo- promoting a specific bank, building of bank, area bank is in, etc. Mostly positive comments.  \r\nSo, to do this my group put 1000 statements about the Banks into a google document and went and read all 1000 of them and labeled them according to what we thought they would create. I think with more time this would've maybe worked if we could fix the code and maybe label more.  \r\nInstead, because this didn't work I used key words to pull specific statements out of the codes.  \r\nThe key words I used are:  \r\n1. ATM-any statement/comment that has the word \"ATM\" in it, whether it be positive or negative.  \r\n2. Fees-any statement/comment that has the word \"fees\" in it, whether it be positive or negative.  \r\n3. Fraud-any statement/comment that has the word \"fraud\" in it, whether it be positive or negative.  \r\n4. Investment- any statement/comment that has the word \"investment\" in it, whether it be positive or negative.  \r\n5. Job- any statement/comment that has the word \"job\" in it, whether it be positive or negative.  \r\n6. Online- any statement/comment that has the word \"online\" in it, whether it be positive or negative.  \r\n7. Service- any statement/comment that has the word \"service\" in it, whether it be positive or negative.  \r\nThese, instead of the labels, made it much more specific because instead of trying to read the labels and decide what they meant, (and maybe make mistakes while labeling them) and instead go through all of the data and automatically find anything with that specific word in it. This below is the main average sentiment score of all the banks.  \r\n![Average Sentiment Scores with Special Topics](http://i.imgur.com/F859mU9.png)  \r\nThis is the code of how to find the average sentiment score of all the banks and how to split up the data with the code words.  \r\n```\r\n# boxplot\r\nlibrary(ggplot2)\r\n#Bank's Sentiment Scores\r\nggplot(scores, aes(x=bankid, y=score, group=bankid)) +\r\n  geom_boxplot(aes(fill=bankid)) +\r\n  scale_fill_manual(values=cols) +\r\n  geom_jitter(colour=\"gray40\",position=position_jitter(width=0.2), alpha=0.3) +\r\n  labs(title = \"Bank's Sentiment Scores\") + \r\n  xlab('Bank') + ylab('Sentiment Score')\r\n\r\n# barplot of average score\r\nmeanscore = tapply(scores$score, scores$bankid, mean)\r\ndf.plot = data.frame(bankid=names(meanscore), meanscore=meanscore)\r\ndf.plot$bankids <- reorder(df.plot$bankid, df.plot$meanscore)\r\n\r\nggplot(df.plot, aes(x = factor(bankids), y = meanscore, fill=bankids)) +\r\n  geom_bar(stat=\"identity\") +\r\n  scale_fill_manual(values=cols[order(df.plot$meanscore)]) +\r\n  labs(title = \"Average Sentiment Score\") + \r\n  xlab('Bank') + ylab('Average Score') \r\n```   \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n# **Bank A**\r\n###*Welcome to Bank A's page!* \r\nFirst you can see these two pictures below of the Average Very Positive Sentiment Scores of Bank A and the Average Very Negative Sentiment Scores of Bank A.   \r\n![VPosBankA](http://i.imgur.com/SKIEDNY.png)  \r\n  \r\n![VNegBankA](http://i.imgur.com/IJfa55T.png)  \r\n  \r\nAs you can see, in the positive charts, online and jobs are the highest, with service following close behind. Online being this high is a very good thing because if positive things are being said about the way the bank runs online, and we all know what happens online is a very big deal or this data wouldn't exist at all.  \r\nIn the negative chart, you can see how high fraud is, which is very expected.  \r\nMake sure you look at the numbers on the side of the charts, just because one looks higher than another on the positive chart rather than the negative chart doesn't mean they actually are! The positive and negative comments about service are actually pretty equal though they don't really look it.  \r\n  \r\nBelow is some code which can help you understand how these charts are made. In this code, anything after a # can explain to you what is going on.  \r\n```\r\nR # barplot of average very positive\r\nlabel_pos = ddply(scores, .(label), summarise, mean_pos=mean(very.pos))\r\nlabel_pos$labels <- reorder(label_pos$label, label_pos$mean_pos)\r\n\r\nggplot(label_pos, aes(x = factor(label), y = mean_pos, fill=label)) +\r\n  geom_bar(stat=\"identity\") +\r\n  scale_fill_manual(values=cols[order(df.plot$meanscore)]) +\r\n  labs(title = \"Topics's Average Very Positive Sentiment Score  of BankA\") + \r\n  xlab('Topic') + ylab('Average Score')\r\n\r\n# barplot of average very negative\r\nlabel_neg = ddply(scores, .(label), summarise, mean_neg=mean(very.neg))\r\nlabel_neg$labels <- reorder(label_neg$label, label_neg$mean_neg)\r\n\r\nggplot(label_neg, aes(x = factor(label), y = mean_neg, fill=label)) +\r\n  geom_bar(stat=\"identity\") +\r\n  scale_fill_manual(values=cols[order(df.plot$meanscore)]) +\r\n  labs(title = \"Topics's Average Very Negative Sentiment Score of BankA\") + \r\n  xlab('Topic') + ylab('Average Score')\r\n```  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n# **Bank B**  \r\n###*Welcome to Bank B's Page!*  \r\nFirst you can see these two pictures below of the Average Very Positive Sentiment Scores of Bank B and the Average Very Negative Sentiment Scores of Bank B.     \r\n![PosBankB](http://i.imgur.com/C61c86h.png)  \r\n  \r\n![NegBankB](http://i.imgur.com/f6LllJZ.png)  \r\nSurprisingly, Bank B has a very high positive sentiment score of Fees.. which for example can mean that they are good at reversing fees, giving small fees, or explaining why they have fees. Job is also very high which is normal for most banks.  \r\n  \r\nBank B has the highest of all Bank's in the area of fraud. This is common for most Banks to have a lot of negative comments in fraud but Bank B being the highest should be something the company should look into.  \r\n   \r\n  \r\nBelow, you can see some of the code used to create these positive and negative graphs.  \r\n   \r\n```\r\n\r\n# This scans through data for positive and negative characters\r\npos <- scan('positive-words.txt',what='character',comment.char=';')\r\nneg <- scan('negative-words.txt',what='character',comment.char=';')\r\n\r\n# barplot of average very positive\r\nlabel_pos = ddply(scores, .(label), summarise, mean_pos=mean(very.pos))\r\nlabel_pos$labels <- reorder(label_pos$label, label_pos$mean_pos)\r\n\r\nggplot(label_pos, aes(x = factor(label), y = mean_pos, fill=label)) +\r\n  geom_bar(stat=\"identity\") +\r\n  scale_fill_manual(values=cols[order(df.plot$meanscore)]) +\r\n  labs(title = \"Topics's Average Very Positive Sentiment Score  of BankB\") + \r\n  xlab('Topic') + ylab('Average Score')\r\n\r\n# barplot of average very negative\r\nlabel_neg = ddply(scores, .(label), summarise, mean_neg=mean(very.neg))\r\nlabel_neg$labels <- reorder(label_neg$label, label_neg$mean_neg)\r\n\r\nggplot(label_neg, aes(x = factor(label), y = mean_neg, fill=label)) +\r\n  geom_bar(stat=\"identity\") +\r\n  scale_fill_manual(values=cols[order(df.plot$meanscore)]) +\r\n  labs(title = \"Topics's Average Very Negative Sentiment Score of BankB\") + \r\n  xlab('Topic') + ylab('Average Score')\r\n```\r\n  \r\n  \r\n# **Bank C**  \r\n### *Welcome to Bank C's Page!*  \r\nFirst you can see these two pictures below of the Average Very Positive Sentiment Scores of Bank C and the Average Very Negative Sentiment Scores of Bank C.  \r\n  \r\n![posbankc](http://i.imgur.com/c8r7k3N.png)  \r\n  \r\n![negbankc](http://i.imgur.com/Jg27NVY.png)  \r\n  \r\nHere you can see in the average positive sentiment scores for Bank C that jobs, online, and service are the highest which is a good thing, especially service and online being high because those are two of the most important things to consider.   \r\n  \r\nIn the average negative sentiment scores for Bank C you can see that fraud is very high, which means most of the negative comments about Bank C have to do with fraud. Also, though you may not notice, ATM is actually more negative than positive even though it doesn't look like it. This is definitely something Bank C's company should look into.  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nBelow is some code to help you see how these plot graphs are created.  \r\n  \r\n```\r\n# how to create columns and the colors that represent them.\r\ncols = c(\"red\", \"yellow\", \"magenta\", \"cyan\", \"blue\", \"green\", \"gray\")\r\nnames(cols) = c(\"ATM\", \"Fees\", \"Fraud\", \"Investment\",\"Job\", \"Online\", \"Service\")\r\n\r\n# boxplot\r\nlibrary(ggplot2)\r\n#Topics's Sentiment Scores\r\nggplot(scores, aes(x=label, y=score, group=label)) +\r\n  geom_boxplot(aes(fill=label)) +\r\n  scale_fill_manual(values=cols) +\r\n  geom_jitter(colour=\"gray40\",position=position_jitter(width=0.2), alpha=0.3) +\r\n  labs(title = \"Topics's Sentiment Scores  of BankC\") + \r\n  xlab('Topic') + ylab('Sentiment Score')\r\n\r\n# barplot of average score\r\nmeanscore = tapply(scores$score, scores$label, mean)\r\ndf.plot = data.frame(label=names(meanscore), meanscore=meanscore)\r\ndf.plot$labels <- reorder(df.plot$label, df.plot$meanscore)\r\n\r\nggplot(df.plot, aes(x = factor(labels), y = meanscore, fill=labels)) +\r\n  geom_bar(stat=\"identity\") +\r\n  scale_fill_manual(values=cols[order(df.plot$meanscore)]) +\r\n  labs(title = \"Topics's Average Sentiment Score  of BankC\") + \r\n  xlab('Topic') + ylab('Average Score')\r\n```  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n#**Bank D**  \r\n###*Welcome to Bank D's page!*  \r\nFirst you can see these two pictures below of the Average Very Positive Sentiment Scores of Bank D and the Average Very Negative Sentiment Scores of Bank D.  \r\n  \r\n![PosBANKd](http://i.imgur.com/AlkqlA1.png)  \r\n  \r\n![](http://i.imgur.com/VQhwyeF.png)   \r\n  \r\nFees, Jobs, Online, and Service are more positive than negative in the sentiment scores which is a really good thing.  \r\n  \r\nAS expected, Fraud is a lot higher on the negative sentiment charts but ATM is almost equal if you compare both, and investment is actually more negative than positive. Investment is a key thing to choosing which bank you want to put your investments in and if it has more negative comments than positive, the company Bank D should definitely look into this and try to make it better.   \r\n  \r\nBelow is some code to help you understand how these average negative and positive sentiment scores were calculated.  \r\n  \r\n```\r\n# barplot of average very positive\r\nlabel_pos = ddply(scores, .(label), summarise, mean_pos=mean(very.pos))\r\nlabel_pos$labels <- reorder(label_pos$label, label_pos$mean_pos)\r\n\r\nggplot(label_pos, aes(x = factor(label), y = mean_pos, fill=label)) +\r\n  geom_bar(stat=\"identity\") +\r\n  scale_fill_manual(values=cols[order(df.plot$meanscore)]) +\r\n  labs(title = \"Topics's Average Very Positive Sentiment Score  of BankD\") + \r\n  xlab('Topic') + ylab('Average Score')\r\n\r\n# barplot of average very negative\r\nlabel_neg = ddply(scores, .(label), summarise, mean_neg=mean(very.neg))\r\nlabel_neg$labels <- reorder(label_neg$label, label_neg$mean_neg)\r\n\r\nggplot(label_neg, aes(x = factor(label), y = mean_neg, fill=label)) +\r\n  geom_bar(stat=\"identity\") +\r\n  scale_fill_manual(values=cols[order(df.plot$meanscore)]) +\r\n  labs(title = \"Topics's Average Very Negative Sentiment Score of BankD\") + \r\n  xlab('Topic') + ylab('Average Score')\r\n```\r\n  \r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
